Terraform Code creates VPC,EC2 instances in public and private subnets,RDS postrgress instance in private subnets. This is not a complete infrastructure.

Terraform workspace will be created to create new environment for Dev/Test/prod with dynamic variables for reproducibility. Any number of environments can be created and destroyed within minutes using this approach. Also all the resources like VPC, subnets, EC2 instances,etc were created using modules which can be reused across organization. 

Run below commands to provision the infrastructure for Dev Environment. 
   
terraform init
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace select dev
terraform plan -var-file=vars/dev.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=vars/dev.tfvars -auto-approve

Run below commands to provision the infrastructure for prod Environment.  

terraform init
terraform workspace new prod
terraform workspace select prod
terraform plan -var-file=vars/prod.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=vars/prod.tfvars -auto-approve
